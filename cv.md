### About Me
___

*I am Sergey Voronin, an information technology specialist in a government organization. I am engaged in the development and technical support of information systems. I'm 33 and I want to change my field of activity to what I'm really interested in - programming. I plan to study frontend in rs-school, then backend - C# and .Net and become a first-class specialist in the field of web development. There is a lot of hard work ahead, but when, if not now?*
